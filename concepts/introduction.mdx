# Welcome to RFQ Protocol

RFQ Protocol enables **gasless, atomic token swaps** by sourcing fixed quotes from professional market makers—delivering better pricing, zero slippage, and MEV protection.

## What is RFQ?

RFQ (Request for Quote) is a trading model where users request fixed prices from professional market makers and execute the trade only after explicitly accepting the quote. It enables better pricing, zero slippage, and MEV protection, especially for large or illiquid trades.

    B --> D[Solver 2]
    C --> B
    D --> B

```

**Flow:**
1. User requests quote from RFQ Coordinator
2. Coordinator queries all registered solvers
3. Solvers return their quotes
4. Coordinator returns the best quote to user
5. User signs and submits intent
6. Coordinator collects solver signature for the intent
7. Trade is settled atomically on-chain via the RFQSettlement contract

## Architecture Overview

The RFQ system consists of three main components:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **RFQ Coordinator** | Off-chain coordinator that aggregates quotes from solvers |
| **Solver** | Market maker that provides quotes and liquidity |
| **RFQSettlement** | Smart contract that executes atomic swaps on-chain |

<Note>
  **Trust Assumption:** The RFQ Coordinator does not custody user funds and cannot execute trades without valid user and solver signatures.
</Note>

## Supported Networks

RFQ Protocol is EVM-compatible and can be deployed on any EVM chain. See the [configuration endpoint](/frontend/api/get-config) for currently supported networks.
