# Getting Started as a Solver

Welcome to the RFQ Protocol solver integration guide. Solvers (market makers) provide liquidity to the protocol by responding to quote requests and executing trades.

## What is a Solver?

A solver is a market maker service that:
- Receives quote requests from the RFQ Coordinator
- Returns competitive prices based on your pricing strategy
- Signs swap intents when users want to execute trades
- Has tokens transferred atomically via Permit2

## Quick Overview

    participant User
    participant RFQ Coordinator
    participant Solver
    participant Chain

    User->>RFQ Coordinator: GET /quote (request price)
    RFQ Coordinator->>Solver: POST /quote (request price)
    Solver-->>RFQ Coordinator: Return quote with expiry
    RFQ Coordinator-->>User: Best quote

    User->>RFQ Coordinator: POST /intent (signed by user)
    RFQ Coordinator->>Solver: POST /intent (forward to solver)
    Solver-->>RFQ Coordinator: Return signed maker intent
    RFQ Coordinator->>Chain: Execute settlement
```

## Requirements

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Solver Wallet** | EOA with sufficient token balances |
| **HTTPS Endpoint** | Publicly accessible API endpoint |
| **Price Feed** | Real-time price data for your markets |
| **Permit2 Approval** | Approve Permit2 to spend your tokens |

## Endpoints to Implement

Your solver must expose these endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POST /api/v1/markets` | Return markets you support |
| `POST /api/v1/quote` | Return price quote for a trade |
| `POST /api/v1/intent` | Sign maker intent for settlement |
