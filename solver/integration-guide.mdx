description: "Guide to becoming an RFQ Protocol solver"
---

This guide explains how to set up a solver that provides liquidity to the RFQ Protocol.

## Overview

As a solver, you will:
1. Receive quote requests from the RFQ Coordinator
2. Return competitive prices based on your pricing strategy
3. Sign swap intents when users want to execute trades
4. Have your tokens transferred atomically via Permit2

## Prerequisites

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Solver Wallet" icon="wallet">
    EOA with sufficient token balances for trading
  </Card>
  <Card title="HTTPS Endpoint" icon="server">
    Publicly accessible API endpoint for receiving requests
  </Card>
  <Card title="Price Feed" icon="chart-line">
    Access to real-time price data for your supported markets
  </Card>
  <Card title="Permit2 Approval" icon="check">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Registration

Contact the RFQ Protocol team to register your solver. You'll need to provide:

| Information | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Solver Name | Human-readable identifier |
| API Endpoint | Your HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://solver.example.com`) |
| Supported Markets | Token pairs you'll provide liquidity for |
| Auth Key | Shared secret for request authentication |

<Note>
  Registration is currently manual. Contact the protocol team to get whitelisted.
</Note>

## Required Endpoints

Your solver must implement these endpoints:

### POST /api/v1/markets

Returns the markets you support. See [API Reference](/solver/api/post-markets).

### POST /api/v1/quote

Returns a price quote for the requested trade.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "input_token": "0x...",
  "output_token": "0x...",
  "amount": "1000000000",
  "chain_id": "...",
  "expiry_timestamp": 1705612830000
}
```

**Key fields:**
- `expiry_timestamp`: Coordinator-provided timestamp - use this for your `expiry` in the response

See [API Reference](/solver/api/post-quote) for full details.

### POST /api/v1/intent

Signs the maker's reversed intent for settlement.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "quote_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "chain_id": "1329",
  "user_address": "0x...",
  "intent": {
    "inputToken": "0x...",
    "outputToken": "0x...",
    "inputAmount": "997000",
    "outputAmount": "990000"
  },
}
```

**Key fields:**
- `intent.inputAmount` is the net amount after protocol fee deduction. This is what the solver should use as the maker's `outputAmount`.

See [API Reference](/solver/api/post-intent) for full details.

## Intent Reversal

When you receive an intent request, create a **reversed** intent:

| Taker Field | Maker Field | Transformation |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| `inputToken` | `outputToken` | Swapped |
| `outputToken` | `inputToken` | Swapped |
| `inputAmount` | `outputAmount` | Swapped |
| `outputAmount` | `inputAmount` | Swapped |
| (none) | `counterparty` | Set to taker address |
| `unwrap` | `unwrap` | **Independent** - solver decides |

<Warning>
  Always set `counterparty` to the taker's address. Setting it to zero address exposes the trade to front-running attacks.
</Warning>

<Note>
  The solver's `unwrap` flag is independent of the taker's. You decide whether you want to receive unwrapped native tokens.
</Note>

## Nonce Management

Permit2 uses **unordered nonces** with bitmap tracking. Generate a random 256-bit nonce for each signature:

```
nonce = random 256-bit integer
```

The probability of collision is negligible (1 in 2^256). Do not try to fetch a "current" nonce from the contract.

## Configuration

Get the Permit2 and RFQSettlement contract addresses from the config endpoint:

```bash
curl "https://dev-rfq.saphyre.xyz/api/v1/config?chain_id=<CHAIN_ID>"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "chain_id": "...",
  "chain_name": "...",
  "rfq_settlement_address": "0x...",
  "permit2_address": "0x..."
}
```

## Permit2 Approval

Approve Permit2 to spend your tokens (one-time per token):

```
ERC20.approve(permit2_address, max_uint256)
```

## Security Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Secure Private Key Storage">
    Never hardcode your private key. Use environment variables or a secure key management service.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Validate All Inputs">
    Always validate request parameters to prevent malicious inputs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Verify Quote Before Signing">
    Confirm the quote_id matches one you issued and the amounts are correct.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Monitor Your Positions">
    Track your token balances and inventory to manage risk. Your on-chain balances directly determine `max_size` for your markets — the balance sync process converts your output token balance to input token units for each directional market.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate Limiting">
    Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Market Freshness">
    Solvers must keep their market data fresh. If the coordinator does not receive updated market data from your solver within the configured freshness window, your markets will be considered stale and you will stop receiving quote requests until markets are refreshed. For WSS solvers, this happens automatically via periodic `get_markets` messages. For HTTP solvers, ensure your `/api/v1/markets` endpoint is responsive. Market data includes `max_size` derived from your solver's on-chain balances, so keeping markets fresh also ensures accurate capacity signaling.
